    description="[h2]A QOL Perk to passively collect gold powder in a large radius![/h2]

This is a standalone version of a feature for a separate (work in progress) mod. This non-stackable Perk allows the player to slowly gather nearby gold powder, even without direct contact or line of sight.

Collecting 100k gold powder goes from 2 minutes without the mod to ~25 seconds!

The Perk can be picked up in Holy Mountains or freely obtained by [spoiler]finding a small podium within the Gold Biome.[/spoiler]

Seems to be compatible with Entangled Worlds, but please report any issues if found.
