	description="[h2]A QOL Perk to passively collect gold powder in a large radius![/h2]

This is a standalone version of a feature for a separate (work in progress) mod. This non-stackable Perk allows the player to slowly gather nearby gold powder, even without direct contact or line of sight.

It's useful for the early-game Mines and Coal Pits, but works best in the [spoiler]Gold Biome[/spoiler]. Collecting 100k gold powder goes from 2 minutes to ~25 seconds!

Currently testing compatibility with Entangled and other mods, please report any issues you find.
